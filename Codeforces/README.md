| Problem | Solution | Approach / Note |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [1526B - I Hate 1111](https://codeforces.com/contest/1526/problem/B) | [Link](./src/B_I_Hate_1111.cpp) | Any number greater than $11 \times 111 - 11 - 111 = 1099$ can be represented as $11a + 111b$. For $x \le 1099$, I used a brute force check. |
| [282A - Bit++](https://codeforces.com/contest/282/problem/A) | [Link](./src/A_Bit++.cpp) | Only checked for the second characters and incremented/decremented accordingly. |
